# hundred-pressups

## What is it?
Hundred press-ups is a fitness tracking mobile app, under development using React Native & Google Firebase.

## But why?
Hundred Press-ups is designed to guide, track and motivate fitness enthusiasts on their path to achieving, well... one hundred press-ups! My first project after graduating the Northcoders Bootcamp, I wanted to explore Google Firebase authentication & database, and hone my knowledge of React Native... also, I need some help to beat my ultra-competitive nephew at his own game!
